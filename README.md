# sonar_pi
Plugin for OpenCPN that shows sonar sensor data.
Data coming from the EchoZilla is displayed on a dockable window inside OpenCPN. It also provides the depth via NMEA sentence provisioning.

* based on wxWidgets 3.2.2.1 - other versions not tested
* needs OpenGL (glut.h)
* based on API 1.18

The EchoZilla project is dead. But there is hope. We are heading for a solution ...

Update:
Thanks to the info from Pavel (https://github.com/aviatorhh/sonar_pi/issues/3) there is an interesting project I will do some testing on. As it just came on the screen some time will be needed to get it running hopefully.
